# OPERATING-SYSTEMS
Operating Systems course @ USI - Universita' della Svizzera Italiana

__THE PROJECTS WERE DEVELOPED DURING THE 2024 SPRING SEMESTER__

The different directories are divided into :

    * PintOS_projectnumber_topic
    * In the Pintos documentation __project numbers may be mismatching__ our project numbers, this is the reason why we added the topic in the folder name!!

ADVISED BY US :

    * __Reports__ are found in each directory for each topic
    * __Reports__ are very detailed and explain every single thing we did so we highly suggest you to read them while checking the code for better understanding!! 

What we used in order to complete all the projects is :

    * __Theory__ from the theory lectures.
    * __Previous Knowledge__ of programming language : C.  
    * __Internet Research__ in order to gain more insights on the topics and more material.

__*Good Luck for the completion of the projects and we hope our code and reports will help you throught it*__
